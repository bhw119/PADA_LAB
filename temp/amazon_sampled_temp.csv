If you hold your phone while its plugged in, it will continually drop the cable on you. The rigidity doesn't allow the cable to bend as you move, and forces the connector to flex back and forth making it wiggle out of the port.I have one of these in my car, wired into the dash and comes out at the phone mount. The setup is static and the wire doesn't wiggle free. So, for that setup its perfect.

132,132,Logitech K350 Wave Ergonomic Keyboard with Unifying Wireless Technology - Black,4.6,24205,5,Logitech K350 Wireless is exceptionally durable,"I purchased one of these when they first came out and paid a LOT more than the price on Amazon now. I liked it a lot and bought a second one in case the first one (this one) died on me. I downloaded the Logitech software with drivers, etc. and this keyboard has outlasted three computers. Each time I replace my computer I download the Logitech unifying software for the keyboard and the rollerball Logitech mouse and off I go. Now the M570 Rollerball does get a bit sloppy after time, but I turn it off then pop the ball out and use alcohol wipes to clean the contact points and the roller ball, then blow it out with canned air, reassemble, turn it on and go again. The Logitech unifying software allows me to recalibrate my M570 and make it perform just like I want it to. I am on my third rollerball mouse, but this is still my first keyboard. Battery usage is so low I worry about the Duracell leaking before the 'replace battery' light on the kybd tells me it is getting weak. And look at the photo - no wear on any of the keys that I can see and this kybd is approximately five years old and used seven days a week! I have a cat that often SLEEPS on the kybd. I first turn the kybd off using the switch underneath and then I use canned air every day to clear the cat hair. If a key gets sticky from cake crumbs or cat hair balls, etc. I spray foam glass cleaner on the kybd, wipe it down, use cotton swabs to clean between the keys, and then my shop air compressor (90 psi) to blow out any existing residue and moisture. When I upgrade to a new computer, I leave the accompanying kybd in its box and my friends know that if they need a wired kybd that I usually have one or two. If I want to change the function of a key, I use a program named 'Sharpkeys' by RandyRants and it is so easy to customize the keys my Logitech K350 to just what I want them to do. I have not talked about FEATURES. I am running a business and I do not use most of the added features on this keyboard. I am sure some users would not like some things about the K350, and that's a buyer's preference and I will not go there. But for durability and functionality, this is the best kybd I have had in the thirty plus years that I have been in the computer business.",2022-05-11,1,1,49.99,359,6,444,0.4,10.6,82.78

I was very pleasantly surprised:  The newest version of the basic DAC (with the 5.5mm barrel power plug) seems to be the DAC01s.  This version has a bit more headroom -- at least, my unit does -- and starts to clip around -2dB.  That's a noticeable improvement, and better than some of the $30-50 competitors that I've tried.  As such, for the money I've upgraded my review to 5 stars.  It still won't rival a $200+ DAC, but I don't think that's a real issue.I've got a couple of different PROZOR adapters.  All of them appear to be based on the same basic circuits.  They are small, inexpensive, and work flawlessly -- with one important limitation:  the maximum 'clean' output occurs about 6dB below a full 0dB digital input.  I've looked at the output, and the lower half of a sine wave starts to flatten out when the DAC is pushed really hard.  The thing is, the specs for these adapters say the maximum output is ""3V.""  Assuming that this is 3VRMS, the maximum sine output would be +/- 4.25V, or 8.5V peak-to-peak.  That happens to be the output when the adapter is driven with a -6dB sine wave (give or take a little).  So, one could argue that the DAC is 'calibrated wrong.'  I look at it as a design choice:  most customers will use this adapter with a TV or XBOX and a small stereo system or a soundbar.  In this setup, the volume is rarely turned up all the way, and if it was the sound system would probably already distort before that point.  So, PROZOR chose to set up the DAC so that it offers the maximum range in the area most needed by an average customer.  Unfortunately, this means that anyone buying the product for high-fidelity audio needs, where 0dB input generally provides an undistorted output, will likely be a little disappointed.  I use one to expand a Focusrite USB audio interface, and just turn down the gain of signals that go to it in my DAW.  6dB sounds like a lot, but it works out to 1MSB -- leaving 23 bits of usable audio range.  If that isn't OK for your needs, then you should look at other, more expensive DACs.",2022-07-12,13,0,13.85,293,8,394,0.6,9.13,79.7

Won't do that again.I decided to go ahead and try top set it up, because it's not here to win a beauty contest, it's to keep my kid from looking at porn. I install the Nighthawk app, set it all up, connect, and all is good for about one minute. I go to do the parental settings, and discover you have to use a third party app for $5 a month to do that. If it works I'll pay it, and there's a free trial so I have nothing to lose at this point. I sign up for the free trial of ""Circle"", set it all up, and get to the part where I assign some controls. I set a blanket level control of ""teen"" for the internet, and tested it out. It didn't work the first time I searched for nefarious things , but the second time it did. Then I realize that the modem has two networks it's serving up for me. The one I set up with a password, and the other is the same thing but with -5G on the end. Problem is, the ""5G"" one had no security, and you could search and find anything you wanted on it. So I go back into the ""Nighthawk"" app to try and check out the settings, and it WILL NOT CONNECT to either network. Keeps saying ""looks like you're not connected to the network"", although I can clearly use it to search and find whatever.So yeah, this thing is going back.",2020-05-19,1,0,175.99,1064,8,309,3.3,7.52,88.87

I just think customers would rather buy extra things to go with the thing they ALREADY  purchased because they WANT to, not because they have to not knowingly,  in order for the product to work as it was described by the vendor.  I would still recomend buying this camera it's a good product,  i have had it a year and it still works really good, but for me it's not really cost affective for what I need because of the subscription around $30 a year.",2020-03-28,3,0,57,1104,17,285,1.3,38.98,0.43

My other fiber cables are a tiny bit bigger than the actual fiber optic cable itself. Nicely packed, plenty of length. It works, so there's not much to say beyond that. Asking about 'sound quality' is absurd.It's FIBER. How does Amazon THINK the sound quality is?",2022-02-03,0,0,8.99,425,3,102,0.4,6.47,78.96

663,663,NB North Bayou Monitor Desk Mount Stand Full Motion Swivel Monitor Arm with Gas Spring for 17-30''Computer Monitors(Within 4.4lbs to 19.8lbs) F80,4.5,17206,5,Great Product!!,"A big thank you to Nathan C. for his very informative comic posted in the reviews. Without it's guidance, I definitely would have given myself a good whack in the face when opening the velcro strap.This thing springs out extremely quickly, like a flailing toddler arm made of steel. I went the whole ""let's drill a hole into my wood furniture"" route to mount this beast. I suggest having an extra person assist you if you do this. Not to drill the hole, they would just be in the way, although I suppose you could have them on hand with a fire extinguisher if you do what I did and just drill the hole in a wooden table in a closed room next to some nice flammable paper. On the upside my room smelled like a fresh outdoor campfire for a while.Anyway, once you have drilled a hole, realized it was too close to the edge for your liking, and drilled another one about an inch further up, you can now commence bolting the thing down. This is where that other person comes in handy. Have them set down the fire extinguisher, and choose whether you want them to hold the arm upright on the table, or hunch down under the desk to put the faceplate and wingnut on the bolt. If they are shorter than you and can say the word ""wingnut"" without giggling like a madman, I suggest you have them do this so you can keep the arm aligned with the desk and not off-kilter like a psychopath who doesn't care how their monitor feng shui is balanced. Anyway, once they slide the faceplate on and have the wingnut (heh) tight as possible, bend down and forcefully shove them out of the way. They aren't needed anymore.Double check that the faceplate is flush with the desk, and go ahead and give that wingnut one or two more twists that you can probably force into it since your helper was probably cajoled into this and has the strength of a feeble child. Go ahead and play around with the movement of the arm, and once you are satisfied that you understand the range of motion this thing has, slap your monitor on there with the screws provided. Sheepishly call back that other person you rudely pushed out of the way earlier, and have them hold the monitor at a close enough approximation so you can struggle with getting the tiny bolts aligned to their holes. Personally I started at the bottom holes, because I usually do for other tasks; and after I did the top ones it didn't look like it was laying properly so I removed them and started from the bottom. Now, we're here with a fully attached monitor screen, what's next? Unless you are an absolute madlad you probably need to connect the cords at this point. If you did all this with the cords connected, you have problems and you should seek help.Anyway, this device comes with not one, but TWO cages for your cords, lest they become unruly and try to escape. The one on top just needs a simple tug on the side that isn't attached and you can simply slide your cords into this cosy nook. The bottom arm is the final boss of this thing. There are two holes just on the underside of this arm. One is a decoy to trick you and take damage intended for the actual hole. The important hole has a screw inside, but this puppy is NESTLED in there. Now that you have the thing bolted to the desk, there is no great way to access this screw visually without the aid of a mirror. Locate the smallest mirror in your home, or break an existing one and grab a shard, and slide it under the arm, so that you might be able to determine which hole houses The Only Screw That Matters?? Rummage around in your tool box and locate a short enough screwdriver (Phillips) that can rummage around in these holes without banging into the desk and nicking the heck out of it multiple times.After a good, sweaty 15 minutes of trying to visually locate and extract the screw from it's home, becoming enraged and throwing the screwdriver across the room a few times, you should now only have about 5 more minutes before it pops out, seemingly of it's own volition. Now, squeeze, the plastic housing on the arm, and after about 5 minutes of feeling that it's about to come off, it finally will. Now, you can tuck those rebellious cords into this bottom prison. At this point you will realize that your previously well-functioning 6 foot HDMI cord is now entirely too short, since you mounted the screen waaay off to the side so you can have more room on your desk for other things, like additional screens. Rummage around in your drawers for a while until you will a longer cord into existence, or break down and buy an additional cord. I overcompensated, as I do, and bought a 15 foot cord, and now my swivel mount arm can transcend all earthly dimensions with it's range of motion, but now I have about 5 extra feet of cordage haphazardly shoved behind my desk in a tangled mess. I really should have bought the 10 foot cord. Now you can slide your new cord into it's housing and fully enjoy moving your screen around five-thousand seven-hundred and forty-eight times until you find the perfect angle, which you will inevitably lose when you try to show someone else how cool your new monitor arm is. I don't personally like their big yellow logo on the side and base, so I covered it with a piece of black tape that reasonably camouflages itself to the base, but I might put a completely different logo there in the future to trick my friends into thinking some other completely random company made it. Like hey, check out my CoverGirl monitor arm, I bet you didn't think they made those, did you. I mean they don't, but you might be able to trick them for a while and maybe they'll made some kind of social media post about it, and then you can pop up like ""A-HA! You've been bamboozled!"" Anyway, I recommend this swivel mounted arm, it's pretty cool.",2020-05-16,174,1,27.9,1148,2,1066,0.5,11.57,71.68

Moving the Extender room to room to get the best signal is slow, but well automated. Plug it in and wait for the lights to indicate the connection quality. The Netgear becomes a new network.However I did not find the instructions to clearly and accurately relate to the equipment (and your existing wifi software). Connection to the Netgear ""mywifiext.net"" proved impossible with continual error notifications. Using my OS (Windows 10) I eventually went to the network connections to see the extender (which my ISP router had automatically and inconveniently renamed), then I used it to connect a device (a Ring video doorbell) though the newly created extender network. The Netgear, after making the connection to the new network, does work well though some of the suggestions (creating a new SSID and password) might make the process more complex despite the potential security benefit.

This is my work from home desk.  We had bought the desk a couple of years ago because it was cheap.  It was sitting around until Covid happened, then I bought a 27 inch monitor and mounted the arm on the top shelf of the front of the desk in reverse orientation.  You're not supposed to do that, but I did it anyway.  I put some cut up bicycle tube under the mount to keep it from marring the top.  Then I got this itch.... I had a 43 inch monitor at work.....a 4k LED television is really just monitor that streams TV signals (ok...slightly different...but if you compare specs, close enough).  Well, Target had a killer sale on the TCL 43S434 TV and I was off and running.  I mean, this arm is supposed to support just under 20 lbs and the 43 inch TV is 15.5 lbs.  No problem.  It wasn't quite as simple as that, I thought about drilling a hole and using the bolt thru mounting option, but my wife would object to doing that to a 100 year old desk.  So, I built the bracket on the back of the desk out of some excess shelf material laying around.  It's screwed to the back of the desk with 3 inch screws and goes into the top shelf at the back.  It's sturdy.  I then used the bolt thru option rather than the clamp option for extra support.  I had to crank up the tension on the arm spring to support the 43 inch monitor, and had to really tighten the rotating part of the VESA mount because the 43 inch monitor wants to put a whole lot more twist on it than a 27 inch monitor, but it does hold and works very well.

871,871,"Logitech Z623 400 Watt Home Speaker System, 2.1 Speaker System - Black",4.6,16085,4,Great speakers - but manual volume control only!,"Although Amazon says I bought the Analog version, I actually bought the Analog/Optical version.  These speakers don't work as far as remote volume control goes, when you use your Samsung TV's optical audio output.  The volume can only be adjusted manually, I have to get up and move, fer cryin'out loud...I hooked these up to my Samsung smart TV via the optical audio output (because my TV doesn't have any other audio outputs that this Logitech unit accepts).  Works perfectly - but the optical audio output is always at a fixed volume, line out, and cannot be controlled by the TV or other remotes.  In fact the optical audio is ALWAYS output even when it's not selected as an audio output via the TV menu.So I went back to using my less powerful, lesser sound quality Logitech Bluetooth speakers much of the time, which can be volume controlled by the various remotes, and are OK for most uses.  BUT...I leave the Logitech THX system connected, but turned off, or on at the lowest volume setting.  When I want the THX sound quality I just turn it on manually and adjust the volume manually, turning the Bluetooth down as far as it will go (unless I turn it all off and disconnect it, it keeps asking on-screen to re-connect).It's a kluge, but workable.  I'm not happy with not being able to adjust the volume remotely, only manually but I can live with that when I'm watching a movie.  I guess I'll HAVE to live with that, unless/until Samsung does a software update that allows the optical audio output to be volume controlled by the remote.  I'm not holding my breath for that as it's been several years that Samsung TVs have been like this with respect to optical digital audio output.If all this seems like a lot of trouble, it is.  But  it's worth it - the difference in the sound quality over Bluetooth is immediately noticeable, in the deeper bass, the crisper midrange and highs.

Hands down.,"I bought one of these back in 2007, and put in a AA. I had no idea at the time that I had just purchased something that would be with me for a LONG time. To be honest, I've got ADHD and ASD, and the shiny blue, perfectly round heavy ball looked amazing to play with, and super tempting. I told myself I would NOT play with this fancy toy until the mouse broke. This would be a very long exercise in keeping my word to myself and resisting temptation. This mouse was super easy to use, I just plugged in the little dongle, and it was ready to go. Loved how quick it was to plug and play, and while the tracker ball took a little getting used to, considering I had only used the movable kind of mouse before, I found it fairly intuitive and easily adapted to using it. This mouse has customizable buttons on it, that I was able to set things to for playing MMOs, It was quick and dependable for letting me get high scores on flash games. I am an artist, and one day my Wacom tablet broke, and I just.... used the mouse. Because of the smoothness of the tracker ball, I was able to draw with it and get the lines smooth and right where I wanted them. After a year or so, the mouse stopped working! I was confused at first, and then I remembered the battery! I pulled out the battery and swapped out for another AA, and it was right back to how it was before! Darn, no sparkly tempting blue orb for me. This mouse outlasted my computer, another computer, countless laptops, and is now on another desktop.... All easy swaps of the little dongle, and no fuss. This mouse started out being plugged into a computer with XP, then was moved to one with Vista, then Windows 7, then landed on Windows 10.  I've used it for art, for regular computer things, for gaming, all sorts of things... All waiting to play with the blue orb of temptation. Every year or so I would need to replace the battery, and each time I was hopeful that the thing had FINALLY worn out... I would pull it apart, use a screwdriver to clear out pet hair, whatever fluff had gotten in the sensors, put it back together, add a fresh battery, and it was always as good as new.I can't tell you how many times it's been dropped, flat out thrown (I have three kids, who are super destructive) I've moved a couple of times, got married, had kids my life is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than when I bought this thing. At one point a hot glue gun had been set on it before it was cool, and it had MELTED a hole through the plastic... but everything still worked 100% fine. I've pretty much given up on this thing EVER giving out on me. I figure it will outlive me at this point. Aliens in 10,000 years will excavate the earth, find this stupid mouse, with its a shiny blue orb of temptation, plug in the dongle (that magically will fit their systems), and start using the mouse to navigate their space ship.So this fall, when the mouse stops working, I'm like ""When was the last time I changed the battery? I don't remember. Guess it's time to do that again (I've said a year, but in truth it depends, and I've gotten anywhere from 10 months to 18 months on a battery). I pull it apart, unscrew the case, clean all the components and sensors, put it back together, put a fresh battery in, and... IT DOESN'T WORK. I'm shocked at first. I assume there's something wrong with the battery.  I try a new fresh battery, and it STILL doesn't work. At this point, I check to make sure I didn't mess something up putting it back together because I don't believe it's given out. It's been THIRTEEN YEARS with this thing not having issues... THIRTEEN YEARS!!! Literally teared up and felt bad throwing this away (minus the shiny orb of temptation of course).  I pop on Amazon and order a new one, the exact same thing. So far this one is exactly as good and easy to use as the old one, and I figure in 13 years or so I'll probably order a third.",2020-12-22,2,1,87.14,801,7,740,0.4,8.5,78.59

In past models, the jacket was a thick enough diameter to protect the wires from being crushed in the occasional rollover.When I got this latest cable, I noticed right away that the cable diameter was about 1/3 what it had been in the past (probably to cut costs in the manufacturing process). As careful as I tried to be, I did accidentally roll over it 2 days after I got it. Sure enough, one if the wires inside broke because I lost sound on one side.So whoever makes these for Amazon probably decided to save a few pennies by cheapening up the protective jacket & make a few pennies on the other end by selling extra replacements when the newer, cheaper version fails. Not going to happen here because I'm going to buy a different brand of cable going forward.It's unfortunate that they changed the protective jacket because this used to be a good quality cable. I understand that the interior wires are not designed to withstand the force/pressure of being run over by a wheelchair. The entire reason I bought the Amazon Basics brand over their competitors is their manufacturer used better quality raw materials. Until they didn't. Very disappointing. My only piece of advice is if you buy this cable, make sure to buy the absolute shortest length you can get away with to help keep it off the floor so hopefully it'll last longer than mine did.",2021-04-29,4,0,6.99,752,3,323,2.6,11.66,65.15
