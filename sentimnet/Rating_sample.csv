3,"i dont like my stay herefirst of all, When i check in, they said i have a free upgrade but the room does not have elevator the elevator is out of order i am travelling with heavy luggage and an elderly When i climbed the ladder and reached the room, i found other guests luggage is already inside the room Clearly they have made a mistake I climbed again and told them what happened I dont want my mother climb again and i told her to wait at the door first They said pls wait a moment and they really made a mistake 

Mistakes happens and i dont think is a big problem I said i dont need a upgrade please just give me a room with elevator They just asked me to wait without a single apology The attitude is so bad  feel like i am the one causing trouble

15 mins passed and my mother still waited at the room door Both of us dont have the progress i asked whats happening now and they just said wait i said my mother is waiting at door step There is no way she climb ups and downs again They finally get me a room in another building I said if anyone free and help me to get the luggage into another building all buildings has door steps in front door They said sorry i dont have people who can help   

ok i carry them by myself to another buildings First, climbing down from one building and up for another building

When i checked out again heavy rain outside, no staff show any willingness to help when they see guests struggling with luggages in the door steps Thank you for the gentleman who is another room guest helping me to get through the steps

i think all the equipments in london hotels is similar but the attitude really makes a hugh difference i would not stay here again and i recommend who are reading this review think twice on booking it",1.413,1,1.587,1.587

You are paying way to much for what it really isThe staff were space cadets You ask them something and they wouldnt understand what you were asking 
There was a big mistake with my room service order and the receptionist said to get me a refund but the bar staff only gave me a complimentary drink voucher and 20 off my next food and drink 

If you like to hear what the people next door to you are doing then youll love this hotel Also the doors slam shut so all night you can hear when everyone is getting back to the hotel

The bathroom is so small I would hate to be tall or fat 

My room didnt have a working aircon either and the excuse was that the weather had recently changed from being really warm to really cold Makes no sense to me because aircon would have been on either way",3.353,4,-1.3530000000000002,1.3530000000000002

The manager eventually found my pack and told me it had fallen down the back of something in a back room  it was well after 1am before I was organised in my room and I left just before 8am I really didnt need all the stress and upset the night before such an important day, so despite the hotel itself being amazing, my experience with the loss of my property was very distressing I didnt get any time to explore the area due to trying to sort out my predicament 

I have sent in a formal complaint and suggested they refund my nights stay and as a good will gesture make a donation to the charity I was running for on my behalf JDRF I have also booked again for next years marathon in April as I believe everyone deserves a second chance, so I really hope I get to enjoy it stress free next time",3.296,1,0.7040000000000002,0.7040000000000002

Staff was excellent at all times We were greeted so well at the check in desk 
Concierges were helpful 
Management was approachable and addressed any concernsThe sink in our room would not drain well 
We requested a fix and staff did so 
However, we felt it was not cleaned well afterwards 
We called and someone came to clean it 
The tub also leaked onto the floor We had to put down towels by the tub corner to keep the water soaked up 
The tub sides are very high to climb in for a shower 
However they had low bars on the tub to grab if you can bend over to hold",3.793,4,0.20699999999999985,0.20699999999999985
