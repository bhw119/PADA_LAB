Mistakes happens and i dont think is a big problem I said i dont need a upgrade please just give me a room with elevator They just asked me to wait without a single apology The attitude is so bad  feel like i am the one causing trouble

15 mins passed and my mother still waited at the room door Both of us dont have the progress i asked whats happening now and they just said wait i said my mother is waiting at door step There is no way she climb ups and downs again They finally get me a room in another building I said if anyone free and help me to get the luggage into another building all buildings has door steps in front door They said sorry i dont have people who can help   

ok i carry them by myself to another buildings First, climbing down from one building and up for another building

When i checked out again heavy rain outside, no staff show any willingness to help when they see guests struggling with luggages in the door steps Thank you for the gentleman who is another room guest helping me to get through the steps

The manager eventually found my pack and told me it had fallen down the back of something in a back room  it was well after 1am before I was organised in my room and I left just before 8am I really didnt need all the stress and upset the night before such an important day, so despite the hotel itself being amazing, my experience with the loss of my property was very distressing I didnt get any time to explore the area due to trying to sort out my predicament 

I have sent in a formal complaint and suggested they refund my nights stay and as a good will gesture make a donation to the charity I was running for on my behalf JDRF I have also booked again for next years marathon in April as I believe everyone deserves a second chance, so I really hope I get to enjoy it stress free next time",-0.14827304250072,-0.10891163341902461

Very close to the Kings crossSt Pancras station

Friendly staff that is at reception 247The beds are very tiny, keep that in mind when booking a room Walls are very thin, luckily we didnt have noisy neighbours, but even then you can hear them talk or cough, or hear their tv 

Area is very noisy too, but thats to be expected from a hotel this close to the station",0.3937120553709945,0.21658479021419297

Big room with a desk and a table Good breakfastWindows were not closing very well and you can hear the noise of the AC units and also there was a bar at the ground floor so you could hear the people going out for a smoke the entire night,0.013017693419029749,-0.2913029264962207
"Location was the only good thingWhilst hotel warns about no elevator, it is disappointing there is no solution offered to customers Our electronic door lock went flat and door wasnt locking anymore Staff did fix it, bur it took half hour of our time to be stuck there waiting for the outcome when we were ready to go out for dinner Bundle of hair on a pillow not mine Half of bed was broken had no springs at all No value for money at all",0.007671155157606857,-0.08940200795616084
