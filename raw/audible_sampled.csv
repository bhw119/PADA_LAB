"It is very difficult to form into words a review for this novel Not only does every page have heart wrenching information on it, but when you listen to the audible, it changes everything No man is as eloquent as TaNehisi Coates His words, his mind, his feelings, his memories Everything about this novel takes you into and throughout his life, starting with what made him who he is and into who he hopes his son will be This is such an important lesson for everyone White privilege is something that he discusses without speaking specifically of it So often people shy from the topic of racism, white privilege, or the history of African Americans in our nation They do this for many reasons One being, that they are not educated enough to discuss it Another being that they feel they do not contribute to the problem Well, by readinglistening to this novel, it is quite clear We all contribute to this problem Our own citizens are being hurt, judged, ridiculed and shamed everyday in America for the color of their skin If you are white and you are not talking about this, you are apart of the problemTaNehisi Coates brings the reader through many different situations, some more painful than others They are all important lessons and things that hold such high value When he started, The destroyers are merely men enforcing the whims of our country, correcting interpreting its heritage and legacy This quote alone shows how intensified the problem is in America today Whether you see this abuse everyday or not, whether someone you personally know is being effected by it or not, it is happening and Coates is doing all that he can to not try to teach his son to change it, but to live with it How saddening that a man with such intelligence as Coates does not believe that this problem will change, so he is trying to teach his son to LIVE with it That shows the magnitude of racism in America This novel is a must read for everyone White, black, man, women Does not matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like This evaluates human decency and the lack of it, right here in this land of the free Read this novel Read it again Then listen to Coates narrate it Take notes, cry, feel every word As I am sure you will",05-15-19,5,4.8,31128,0,Anonymous User,Wow,https://www.audible.com/pd/Between-the-World-and-Me-Audiobook/B010N1IC5A,"26434,3372,820,249,253","23558,2865,750,168,143","23229,2831,793,233,212"

"Colsons book is a beautifully written and artfully narrated work of fiction  It describes the travails of Cora, the granddaughter of a kidnapped African and daughter of a strong but absent slave living on a cotton plantation in GeorgiaWhat makes this book a pleasant read is that it touches on several key themes that have often been overlooked and in some cases whitewashed from public school curriculums and our general understanding of what a inhumane and evil business chattel slavery was This book should be required reading for such noted historians as Dr Ben Carson and Kanye WestWhiteheads book uses the physical railroad as a wonderful metaphor that takes the reader on a tour of the key events which describe the Black experience from capture in Africa to freedom, all through the life experiences of this fierce young woman who yearns to be freeI am of the opinion that good historical fiction is always about what is happening now This book would be an important read for Black youths who do not possess a keen understanding of those from whom they sprang and provide a solid baseline from which discussions may be pursued in a public school environment",08-23-18,5,4.4,16238,0,Gary Horton,A Perfect Slavery Primer,https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Underground-Railroad-Television-Tie-in-Audiobook/B01J6CZQGA,"9780,4063,1727,432,236","10568,2842,826,183,107","8612,3520,1626,487,241"

"Everyone has heard of this book, or maybe the movie that was based on it But, I had never read it before I didnt know that Truman Capote was from Alabama and a childhood friend of Harper Lee To Kill a Mockingbird And, that she helped with the research and interviews some have wondered if she helped with some of the writing This book was significant because it was based on a real crime and was written as if it was a summary of the actual events leading up to and after the crime from the perspective of the killers, the townspeople, the investigators, and the trial It is accurate overall, but Capote makes up some of the conversations and many of the locals felt misquoted It started a new genre of historical fiction embellishes and expands on an event The Clutter family was prominent in the community and ran a very profitable large farm They were known for their generosity towards their workers up to 18 hands worked there at times, as well as to others And, he was known in the community for never carrying anything but very minimal cash, paying for everything by check lest there ever be an IRS audit They were strong churchgoers and they seemed to be the last family that something like this would happen to, but in the middle of one November night in 1959, two men entered through the unlocked back door thinking that there was a safe with a lot of money for the taking They were also determined to leave no witnesses and killed all four family members with shotgun blasts to the head We know the story, the killers, and why they did it from almost the beginning of the book, but the author manages to keep our interest all the way to the end without the benefit of suspense It is graphic, not leaving out any details of the murders and delves deeply into the psychology of the killers without excusing them for their actions It was not my favorite book but was nonetheless very good",12-13-19,4,4.4,15147,0,William,True Crime,https://www.audible.com/pd/In-Cold-Blood-Audiobook/B002UZJTXM,"9366,3832,1389,348,212","8883,2511,746,186,116","7954,2899,1106,296,171"

"I have always like Molly Harpers writing style and love Amanda Ronconi as the narrator of the books I was excited for 2 reasons when I saw this title available for preorder First I get another town and area similar to Halfmoon Hollow and all of the residents within Second the addition of a male narrator I have always loved Amanda Ronconi as the narrator for these books because of her ability to give each character their own voice Johnathan Davis was good addition to the book but I could tell when they had him redo certain parts of the story and I even think I could tell when Amanda Ronconi redid some parts It was not seamless as it should have been That is the only issue I had to the performance I have listened to many books with a male and female narrator and I am used to the fact that they both do female and male parts so it did not bother me too muchNow on to the story, I loved the story line and the setup to what I hope will be another excellent series I wish it was longer but I can forgive Molly Harper for that part I love the tension and the buildup between Jillian and Bael throughout the story I also love that we get to watch Jillian learn about the people of the town and even herself as she spends time in Mystic BayouI cannot wait to see what will happen in Mystic Bayou",01-24-18,5,4.6,21522,19,April B,I Excited for What is to Come,https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Date-Your-Dragon-Audiobook/B078892NLF,"14899,4844,1421,265,93","15168,3668,912,141,61","13468,4443,1566,301,120"
