Mistakes happens and i dont think is a big problem I said i dont need a upgrade please just give me a room with elevator They just asked me to wait without a single apology The attitude is so bad  feel like i am the one causing trouble

15 mins passed and my mother still waited at the room door Both of us dont have the progress i asked whats happening now and they just said wait i said my mother is waiting at door step There is no way she climb ups and downs again They finally get me a room in another building I said if anyone free and help me to get the luggage into another building all buildings has door steps in front door They said sorry i dont have people who can help   

ok i carry them by myself to another buildings First, climbing down from one building and up for another building

When i checked out again heavy rain outside, no staff show any willingness to help when they see guests struggling with luggages in the door steps Thank you for the gentleman who is another room guest helping me to get through the steps

The manager eventually found my pack and told me it had fallen down the back of something in a back room  it was well after 1am before I was organised in my room and I left just before 8am I really didnt need all the stress and upset the night before such an important day, so despite the hotel itself being amazing, my experience with the loss of my property was very distressing I didnt get any time to explore the area due to trying to sort out my predicament 

I have sent in a formal complaint and suggested they refund my nights stay and as a good will gesture make a donation to the charity I was running for on my behalf JDRF I have also booked again for next years marathon in April as I believe everyone deserves a second chance, so I really hope I get to enjoy it stress free next time",2022-10-10,8.0,7.9,9315,2,0,"Amazing hotel, just very upset and frustrated the mi placement",4,8.7,8.0,8.4,8.5,7.4,9.1,2024-12-02
