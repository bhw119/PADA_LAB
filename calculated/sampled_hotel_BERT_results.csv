The manager eventually found my pack and told me it had fallen down the back of something in a back room  it was well after 1am before I was organised in my room and I left just before 8am I really didnt need all the stress and upset the night before such an important day, so despite the hotel itself being amazing, my experience with the loss of my property was very distressing I didnt get any time to explore the area due to trying to sort out my predicament 

I have sent in a formal complaint and suggested they refund my nights stay and as a good will gesture make a donation to the charity I was running for on my behalf JDRF I have also booked again for next years marathon in April as I believe everyone deserves a second chance, so I really hope I get to enjoy it stress free next time",2022-10-10,8.0,7.9,9315,2,0,"Amazing hotel, just very upset and frustrated the mi placement",4,8.7,8.0,8.4,8.5,7.4,9.1,2024-12-02,10,423,784,0.0999999999999996,171.09,-332.5,1.25888209590239,1.92105515401654,3.349,1,-0.14827304250072,-0.10891163341902461
